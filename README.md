twinsta.xyz is the twitter client with less opinions!

i'm creating twinsta because it feels like every time i go on twitter, instead of having healthy interactions, i end up feeling more upset than when i first logged on.

say what you will about blacklists, but i think they're fairly useless if in order to use them, you have to first find examples of content that makes you upset to find keywords to include on your blacklist.

my response? remove the text from the timeline entirely. twinsta is centered around photos, hence the name! tw(itter)insta(gram). it will feature a UI that heavily resembles that of instagram, while pulling in tweets from your timeline on twitter, with options to like and retweet pictures from inside the client.

please feel free to contribute if you'd like to see this client become a reality!
